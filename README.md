# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Isolation Forest
## Overview
Credit card fraud detection is a crucial application of machine learning due to the massive volume of daily transactions and the significant financial loss caused by fraud. This project applies an unsupervised learning technique â€” Isolation Forest â€” to detect fraudulent transactions from anonymized credit card data.
Despite the high class imbalance (fraud cases make up just 0.17%), the model achieves a strong performance with ROC-AUC â‰ˆ 0.96, demonstrating its ability to flag anomalies effectively without supervision.
